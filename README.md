# Auth0 Spring Security MVC

This project is no longer maintained and has been discontinued in favor of [auth0-java-mvc-commons](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-java-mvc-common) library. An example on how to use that library with **Spring Security MVC** can be found [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/java-spring-security-mvc).


If you're still looking for the library, the code can be found in the [master](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-spring-security-mvc/tree/master) branch and the latest release in:

Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.auth0</groupId>
    <artifactId>auth0-spring-security-mvc</artifactId>
    <version>1.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

or Gradle:

```gradle
compile 'com.auth0:auth0-spring-security-mvc:1.3.0'
```


## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
